Deploying a subfolder to GitHub Pages involves a few steps to ensure that only the contents of that subfolder are deployed and served correctly. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to deploy a specific subfolder to GitHub Pages:

### 1. Prepare Your Subfolder

Make sure your subfolder (e.g., `dist`, `build`, etc.) contains all the files you want to deploy. Typically, this folder includes your compiled or built assets like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any other static files necessary for your website.

### 2. Create a New Orphan Branch

GitHub Pages deploys from the `gh-pages` branch by default, but if you want to deploy a specific subfolder, you'll need to create an orphan branch (a branch without a commit history) that will only contain the contents of your subfolder.

```bash
# Create a new orphan branch (replace `gh-pages-subfolder` with your preferred branch name)
git checkout --orphan gh-pages-subfolder
```

### 3. Remove Unnecessary Files

Remove all files from this new branch (except for the `.gitignore` file):

```bash
git rm -rf .
git add .gitignore # Add back the .gitignore if needed
```

### 4. Add Your Subfolder's Contents

Copy the contents of your subfolder (`dist`, `build`, etc.) into the root of this branch:

```bash
# For example, assuming your subfolder is `dist`
cp -r ../path/to/your/subfolder/* .
```

### 5. Commit and Push

Commit the changes and push the branch to GitHub:

```bash
git commit -m "Deploying subfolder to GitHub Pages"
git push origin gh-pages-subfolder
```

### 6. Configure GitHub Pages

- Go to your repository on GitHub.
- Navigate to the repository settings.
- Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section.
- Select the branch you just pushed (`gh-pages-subfolder`) from the dropdown menu.
- Save the settings.

### 7. Verify Deployment

GitHub Pages will now deploy the contents of your subfolder. You can access your site using the GitHub Pages URL for your repository (typically `https://username.github.io/repositoryname/`).

### Notes:

- **Custom Domain:** If you have a custom domain, configure it in the GitHub Pages settings.
  
- **Updating Content:** Whenever you update your subfolder (e.g., `dist`), repeat steps 2-5 to update the deployment.

This method allows you to deploy only a specific subfolder to GitHub Pages, keeping your repository clean and organized while serving your website from the desired directory.
